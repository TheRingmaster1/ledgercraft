# Changelog

All notable changes to LedgerCraft are listed here. Versions follow
`0.MINOR.PATCH` until 1.0: each release the maintainer calls is the next
minor version (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …); patch versions (0.1.1) are only for urgent
fixes to a release. See docs/releasing.md.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Tutorial: the window no longer runs off the bottom of the screen and hides
  its Back and Next buttons. It is now 70% of the app window's width and 75%
  of its height (within sensible limits) and follows the window when resized.
- The register's "back to Chart of Accounts" link showed an empty box instead
  of an arrow (egui's font has no arrow glyph).
- Clear on the Create Invoice form no longer closes the app.
- The window can be resized on setups that mix Retina and standard-resolution
  monitors; it no longer opens larger than the screen.
- Home: At A Glance shows its amounts, and no longer overlaps the workflow
  buttons in a narrow window (it moves below them).
- The desktop app builds on Linux (a source file name differed only in case).
- Preferences: Reset To Default resets only the Global settings (row shading
  and Open Menus On Hover); it no longer turns the tutorial back on.

### Added
- Tutorial: thirteen lessons covering the whole app as it stands (getting
  around, company files, the chart of accounts, customers, vendors and items,
  invoicing, payments and deposits, bills, checks and card purchases, journal
  entries, fixing mistakes, reports and preferences). A lesson list, Back and
  Next, and "Try it" buttons that open the form or page being taught, or the
  sample company. A test fails if a form has no lesson.
- Help > Preferences: choose the grey used to shade At A Glance rows. Saved
  per user and kept between launches.
- Preferences are grouped under a selectable Global section (styled like the
  selected side bar item) that shows or hides Row Shading; the shading preview
  is boxed.
- Row Shading applies to every striped list in the app (Chart of Accounts,
  customers, vendors, transactions, form lines, registers and reports), not only
  At A Glance.
- All text uses one dark colour across the app (text with its own colour, such
  as the side bar, links, hints and negative amounts, keeps it).
- Preferences: the Row Shading bar no longer shows a number, and its default
  is the middle of the bar (grey 205).
- A Tutorial window (blank for now) opens at launch until "Never show again"
  is ticked; the choice is saved with the preferences. Help > Tutorial opens it
  on demand (Show Tutorial) or turns it back on for the next launch (Show at
  Next Launch).
- Preferences: Open Menus On Hover (off by default) opens File, Edit, View and
  the other top menus when the pointer rests on them instead of on a click.

### Changed
- Home: "At A Glance" heading, with a divider in the side bar colour between
  the workflow and At A Glance.
- Home: every other At A Glance row is shaded grey, and the Workflow and
  At A Glance headings are underlined.
- Home: all At A Glance labels and amounts use the same dark text colour.
